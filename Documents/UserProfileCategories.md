# User Profile Categories: Comprehensive Design Document

## Executive Summary

This document defines a comprehensive user profile system for ChatHub - an anonymous chat application that balances rich user detail collection with privacy protection. The profile system is organized into 8 distinct categories, plus references to existing subscription and reputation systems.

## Design Principles

### 1. Anonymous but Detailed
- Collect rich profile data without compromising anonymity
- Show only safe, user-facing categories publicly
- Use system-facing categories for safety, ranking, and access control

### 2. Data Collection Strategy
- **Explicit input**: User directly provides information via forms and pills
- **Implicit behavioral**: Derive insights from app usage patterns
- **System safety**: Aggregate moderation signals without storing raw content

### 3. Storage Philosophy
- Maintain backward compatibility with existing Firebase structure
- Introduce normalized `Users/{uid}/Profile/*` subdocuments alongside current storage
- Single source of truth per data type to avoid conflicts

### 4. Privacy-First Approach
- Never store raw offensive content in safety signals
- Use only approved tags for interests (user explicitly accepts via pills)
- Limit free-text inputs to minimize policy violations

## Naming Conventions

### Field Naming
- **Format**: lowercase_snake_case (e.g., `voice_allowed`, `zodiac_gemini`)
- **Boolean values**: Use tri-state system with strings: `"true"`, `"false"`, `"null"`
- **Positive phrasing**: Prefer `X_allowed` over `no_X` to avoid confusion

### Firebase Paths
```
Users/{uid}                         // Root: immutable basics + current usage
Users/{uid}/Profile/media           // Mutable: profile pictures
Users/{uid}/Profile/about_you       // Binary/tri-state flags  
Users/{uid}/Profile/inputs          // Limited free-text fields
Users/{uid}/Profile/interests       // User-approved tags only
Users/{uid}/Profile/activity        // Behavioral counters
Users/{uid}/Profile/safety          // Moderation counters (no raw content)
Users/{uid}/Profile/location        // IP-derived geographic data
```

**Note**: Subscription and Reputation data are read from existing Firebase paths where they are currently written (no duplication needed).

## External Data References

### Subscription (Commerce Status)
**Data Source**: Read from existing subscription system Firebase paths where purchase/renewal events are written
**Display**: Profile badges, feature gates
**Implementation**: ✅ Use existing subscription managers

### Reputation (Community Standing)  
**Data Source**: Read from existing report/block system Firebase paths where moderation events are written
**Display**: Internal safety algorithms only (not shown on profiles)
**Implementation**: ✅ Use existing moderation managers

## Data Flow Architecture

### Information Collection Flow
```
User Actions → Data Processing → Storage → Display

1. Signup → Basic Info + IP Location → Users/{uid} + Profile/location → Profile Header
2. Edit Profile → AboutYou + UserInputs → Root + Profile/* → Profile Sections  
3. Chat Messages → NLP Analysis → Interests Pill → Profile/interests
4. Call/Live/Photos → Event Counters → Profile/activity → Activity Indicators
5. Moderation Triggers → Safety Counters → Profile/safety → Internal Only
6. Purchase Events → Subscription Status → Existing paths → Profile badges
7. Reports/Blocks → Reputation Counters → Existing paths → Internal algorithms
```

### Storage Migration Strategy

#### Phase 1: Dual Write (Current)
- Continue all existing writes to current locations
- Add mirror writes to new `Profile/*` subdocuments
- Maintain backward compatibility

#### Phase 2: Read Preference
- Update read logic: try `Profile/*` first, fallback to root
- Validate data consistency between old and new locations

#### Phase 3: Migration (Future)
- Batch migrate existing data to subdocuments
- Remove legacy read paths
- Clean up redundant root fields

## Display Guidelines

### Profile View Hierarchy
1. **Primary**: Basics (header) + Media (photo) + Location/Time
2. **Secondary**: AboutYou pills (categorized) + Interests grid
3. **Tertiary**: UserInputs details + Activity subtleties
4. **Hidden**: SafetySignals, Reputation details (internal only)

### Discovery Card Priority
1. Profile photo (if available)
2. Name, age, gender
3. Location (country/city) + Local time
4. Top 3-4 AboutYou flags (most relevant)
5. Top 3 interests
6. Subscription badge (if premium)

### Edit Profile Organization
1. **Media Section**: Photo upload (editable)
2. **Details Section**: UserInputs fields (height, occupation, etc.) (editable)
3. **About You Section**: Categorized pills interface (editable)
4. **Interests Section**: Approved + suggested tags management (editable)

**Note**: Basics (immutable), Activity (derived), Location (IP-derived), SafetySignals (internal) are not editable by users.

## Privacy and Safety Framework

### User Control
- ✅ Users control all AboutYou flags
- ✅ Users approve all interests before storage  
- ✅ Users control all UserInputs content
- ❌ Users cannot see or control SafetySignals/Reputation

### Data Minimization
