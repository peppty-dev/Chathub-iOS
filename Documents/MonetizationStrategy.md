## Feature Distribution Logic & Psychology

### 1. Discovery Features (Lite Tier Entry Point)
**Features**: Refresh, Filters, Search
**Psychology**: These are "table stakes" features that users expect in a modern chat app. Placing them in the entry tier:
- Creates immediate value perception
- Low barrier to entry for first subscription
- Addresses the most common user frustration (limited discovery)
- Establishes premium habit formation

**Business Logic**:
- High-frequency usage features drive daily engagement
- Low implementation cost, high perceived value
- Creates dependency on premium features quickly

### 2. Communication Freedom (Plus Tier Differentiation)
**Features**: Live calls, No conversation limit
**Psychology**: Addresses social connection anxiety and FOMO:
- "What if I want to talk to more people?" → No conversation limit
- "What if I want to see and talk to someone live?" → Live calls
- Creates urgency around social opportunities

**Business Logic**:
- Conversation limits are the biggest pain point for engaged users
- Live calls are high-engagement, sticky features
- Plus tier captures users ready for deeper social interaction
- Natural upgrade path from Lite when users hit conversation walls

### 3. Complete Communication (Pro Tier Premium Experience)
**Features**: Voice calls, No message limit
**Psychology**: Targets perfectionist and professional users:
- "I don't want any restrictions" → Complete freedom
- "I'm a power user" → Pro tier identity
- "Professional communication needs" → No limits

**Business Logic**:
- Highest ARPU (Average Revenue Per User) tier
- Targets users with highest lifetime value
- Message limits become painful for heavy users
- Voice calls add professional communication value

## Psychological Pricing Strategies

### 1. Anchoring Effect
- **Pro tier** serves as anchor (highest price)
- Makes **Plus tier** appear reasonably priced
- **Lite tier** seems like a "steal" by comparison

### 2. Decoy Effect
- **Plus tier** positioned as "most popular" choice
- Has significantly more features than Lite for moderate price increase
- Makes Pro seem like "just a bit more" for complete experience

### 3. Loss Aversion
- Free users experience feature limitations as "losses"
- Cooldown periods create urgency to upgrade
- Conversation limits create FOMO (Fear of Missing Out)

### 4. Progressive Disclosure
- Features revealed gradually through tier progression
- Each tier solves specific pain points from previous tier
- Creates natural upgrade path

## Feature Limitation Implementation

### Message Limits
- **Free/Lite/Plus**: Subject to `freeMessagesLimit` per user per cooldown period
- **Pro**: Unlimited messages (`hasProAccess()` bypass)
- **Cooldown**: `freeMessagesCooldownSeconds` between limit resets
- **New Users**: Temporary bypass during `newUserFreePeriodSeconds`

### Conversation Limits
- **Free/Lite**: Subject to `freeConversationsLimit` with cooldown
- **Plus/Pro**: Unlimited conversations (`isUserSubscribedToPlus()` bypass)
- **New Users**: Temporary bypass during free period

### Live Call Limits
- **Free/Lite**: Completely blocked
- **Plus**: 18,000 seconds (5 hours) per subscription period
- **Pro**: 18,000 seconds (5 hours) per subscription period
- **Reset Policy**: Time allocation resets on subscription renewal/payment
- **Permission Gates**: Camera/microphone permissions required

### Voice/Video Call Limits
- **Free/Lite/Plus**: Completely blocked
- **Pro**: 18,000 seconds (5 hours) per subscription period
- **Reset Policy**: Time allocation resets on subscription renewal/payment
- **Cost Control**: Prevents excessive usage that generates high Agora billing

### Discovery Features
- **Refresh**: Gated for free users, unlimited for Lite+
- **Filters**: Basic for free, advanced for Lite+
- **Search**: Completely blocked for free, full access for Lite+

## Revenue Optimization Strategies

### 1. Friction-Based Conversion
- **Conversation Limits**: Create social friction to drive Plus upgrades
- **Message Limits**: Create communication friction to drive Pro upgrades
- **Cooldown Periods**: Time-based friction encourages immediate payment

### 2. Value Stacking
- Each tier contains all features from lower tiers
- Clear value proposition at each level
- No feature removal between tiers

### 3. Usage-Driven Upselling
- Heavy users naturally hit limits and see upgrade prompts
- Feature discovery through usage creates upgrade demand
- Social features create network effects

### 4. Temporal Psychology
- Cooldown timers create urgency
- Live time allocation creates scarcity
- Real-time limitations drive immediate action

### 5. Cost Control Mechanisms
- **Live Call Limits**: Prevent excessive Agora billing from heavy users
- **Voice/Video Call Limits**: Control infrastructure costs while maintaining perceived value
- **Subscription Renewal Reset**: Encourages continued subscription to reset time allowances
- **Background Enforcement**: Limits enforced transparently without degrading user experience

## Conversion Funnel Strategy

### Free → Lite (Discovery Conversion)
**Trigger**: User hits refresh/filter/search limitations
**Value Proposition**: "Unlock discovery tools to find better matches"
**Psychological Drivers**: FOMO, instant gratification
**Typical Timeline**: 3-7 days of active usage

### Lite → Plus (Social Conversion)
**Trigger**: User hits conversation limits or wants live interaction
**Value Proposition**: "Connect with unlimited people and see them live"
**Psychological Drivers**: Social anxiety, connection desire
**Typical Timeline**: 2-4 weeks after Lite subscription

### Plus → Pro (Power User Conversion)
**Trigger**: Heavy messaging usage, professional needs
**Value Proposition**: "Complete communication freedom"
**Psychological Drivers**: Efficiency, status, completeness
**Typical Timeline**: 1-3 months after Plus subscription

## Technical Implementation Notes

### Subscription Checking
```swift
// Plus tier features
subscriptionSessionManager.isUserSubscribedToPlus()

// Pro tier features  
subscriptionSessionManager.hasProAccess()

// New user bypass
isNewUser() // checks newUserFreePeriodSeconds
```

### Feature Gates
- **Discovery Features**: Check subscription tier before allowing access
- **Communication Limits**: Use limit managers with subscription bypasses
- **Live Features**: Require Plus+ with time allocation management
