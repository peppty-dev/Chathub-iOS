## 🔧 **Debugging Common Issues**

### **🐛 Issue 1: User Gets Wrong Routing**

**Search for:**
```bash
grep "Flow ID: FLOW_XXXX" logs.txt
```

**Look for:**
- 🏷️ **User Type** classification
- 🎯 **Routing Decision** and reason
- 🧮 **Algorithm factors** (if Free user)

**Common Causes:**
- Wrong user type detection
- Algorithm threshold misconfiguration  
- Lite user not bypassing algorithm

---

### **🐛 Issue 2: Algorithm Not Running for Free Users**

**Search for:**
```bash
grep "🧮 CONVERSATION-ALGORITHM" logs.txt
```

**Expected Flow:**
1. ✅ User should be classified as **FREE**
2. ✅ Should see **"Running compatibility algorithm"**
3. ✅ Should see **detailed factor analysis**
4. ✅ Should see **routing decision**

**If Missing:**
- Check if user incorrectly classified as Lite+
- Check if Lite bypass check is running incorrectly

---

### **🐛 Issue 3: Popup Not Showing for Lite Users**

**Search for:**
```bash
grep "🔒 CONVERSATION-LIMITS.*LITE" logs.txt
```

**Expected:**
- 🏷️ User Type: **LITE**
- 🚧 Popup Status: **🚧 POPUP_REQUIRED**

**If Shows Bypass:**
- Check `ConversationLimitManagerNew.checkConversationLimit()`
- Ensure only Plus+ users bypass popup

---

### **🐛 Issue 4: Performance Issues**

**Search for:**
```bash
grep "📊 CONVERSATION-PERFORMANCE" logs.txt
```

**Look for:**
- ⏱️ **Total time** > 3 seconds
- ⏱️ **Algorithm time** > 1 second  
- ⏱️ **Chat creation** > 2 seconds

**Common Causes:**
- Firebase network latency
- Complex algorithm calculations
- Multiple database queries

---

## 🔍 **Filtering Logs for Analysis**

### **📊 Filter by Flow ID:**
```bash
grep "FLOW_1734823456_7832" logs.txt
```

### **🏷️ Filter by User Type:**
```bash
grep "User Type: FREE" logs.txt
grep "User Type: LITE" logs.txt  
grep "User Type: PLUS" logs.txt
```

### **🎯 Filter by Routing Decision:**
```bash
grep "Routing: 📥 INBOX" logs.txt
grep "Routing: 💬 DIRECT_CHAT" logs.txt
```

### **🧮 Filter Algorithm Executions:**
```bash
grep "🧮 CONVERSATION-ALGORITHM" logs.txt
```

### **❌ Filter Errors Only:**
```bash
grep "❌ CONVERSATION-ERROR" logs.txt
```

### **📈 Filter Performance Issues:**
```bash
grep "Total Time: [3-9]\\." logs.txt  # >3 seconds
```

    let userType = determineUserType()
    
    // Structured logging automatically handles:
    // - Flow start tracking
    // - Limit check results  
    // - Routing decisions
    // - Success/error states
}
```

### **📖 How to Use in ChatFlowManager:**

```swift
func executeInboxRoutingDecision(...) {
    // Algorithm execution automatically logged with:
    // - Detailed factor analysis
    // - Compatibility scoring
    // - Routing decision reasoning
}
```

## 📈 **Analytics and Monitoring**

### **🎯 Key Metrics to Track:**

1. **Flow Success Rate** - % of flows that complete successfully
2. **Algorithm Performance** - Average algorithm execution time
3. **Routing Distribution** - Inbox vs Direct Chat ratios
4. **User Type Behavior** - Flows by subscription tier
5. **Error Patterns** - Common failure points

### **📊 Sample Queries:**

```bash
# Success rate by user type
grep "✅ CONVERSATION-SUCCESS" logs.txt | grep -o "User Type: [A-Z]*" | sort | uniq -c

# Average algorithm execution time  
grep "Algorithm: [0-9]" logs.txt | awk '{print $2}' | awk '{sum+=$1; count++} END {print sum/count}'

# Routing decision distribution
grep "🎯 Routing:" logs.txt | grep -o "(INBOX|DIRECT_CHAT)" | sort | uniq -c
```
